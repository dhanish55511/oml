# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will explore the REST APIs for Oracle Machine Learning (OML) Services. The REST API for OML Services provides REST API endpoints hosted on Oracle Autonomous AI Database. Using the REST APIs, you will learn how to deploy an ONNX format model, perform scoring, create and run a data monitoring and model monitoring job to deploy a model, and run a data bias detection job. 

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours
